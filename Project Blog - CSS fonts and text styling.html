A "blog" (or "web log") is an online journal, which one or multiple people
 update on a frequent basis, like daily, weekly, or monthly. Many new
 programmers keep blogs to document their journey to becoming a programmer,
 with updates on what they've learned and what they've made.
There are many "blogging engines" out there, like WordPress and Blogger, but in
 this project, you'll make your own blog using HTML and CSS. It should have at
 least 2 entries, and the table of contents should internally link to each
 entry. Use CSS text properties to style your blog - like changing the
 font family, line height, and font styles of various sections.
If you like your blog, then you could use it to document your journey
here - make it a featured project on your profile, then people that visit your
profile will get to read about your journey!

Does your project meet these goals?
1. Must contain at least two blog posts.
2. Must have a table of contents that links to the posts.
3. Must have at least 3 CSS rules.
4.Must use at least 4 different CSS properties that start with "font-".
5. Must not have any errors or bad practices.
6. I certify that this is all my original work. If I took any parts from
elsewhere, then they were non-essential parts of the project, and they are
clearly attributed at the top. I will show I agree to this honor code by
typing "Yes": YES.
