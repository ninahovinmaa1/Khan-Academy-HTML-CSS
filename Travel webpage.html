<!-- Project: Travel webpage
In this project, you'll use everything you've learned so far to create a travel
 website enticing viewers to visit an exotic locale. You should have images of
 what they'll see, lists of things to see and places to go, and paragraphs of
 enticing details. You should also use CSS to style the website, using a mix of
  the simple selectors you've learned.

Tip: Can't find the images you want in our image selector? You can also bring
in images from Wikipedia. To do that, use a site-restricted Google search, then
 click "View image" on the result you like, and copy the URL into your <img>
 tag. -->
